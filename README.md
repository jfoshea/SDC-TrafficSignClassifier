# Traffic Sign Classifier 

## Overview
Develop a Deep Leaning Network to classify traffic signs. To accomplish this a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be developed to classify traffic signs. Specifically the CNN will focus on German traffic signs. [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). Many aspects of TensorFlow, OpenCV, python, numpy, and matplotlib are used to develop the CNN. The CNN code is based on Tensorflow and executed within in a jupyter notebook environment.

## Installing and Running the Classifier
The following steps are used to run the pipeline:
1. Install miniconda environment and related packages
    ```
    https://conda.io/miniconda.html
    ```
2. Clone the SDC-TrafficSignClassifier git repository
    ```  
    $  git clone https://github.com/jfoshea/SDC-TrafficSignClassifier.git
    ```

3. enable cardnd-term1 virtualenv
    ```
    $ source activate carnd-term1
    ```
4. Run the Pipeline 
    ```
    $ jupyter notebook TrafficSignClassifier.ipynb
    ```

The random traffic sign images are located in `random_traffic_signs` directory.
